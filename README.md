#GrafX2
GrafX2 is a bitmap paint program inspired by the Amiga programs [Deluxe Paint](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluxe_Paint) and Brilliance. Specialized in 256-color drawing, it includes a very large number of
tools and effects that make it particularly suitable for pixel art,
game graphics, and generally any detailed graphics painted with a
mouse.
The program is mostly developed on Linux and Windows, but is also
portable on many other platforms.
